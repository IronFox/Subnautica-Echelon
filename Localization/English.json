	"encyclopedia": "The Echelon is designed with the most demanding environments in mind with extensive hunter seeker capabilities.\nIt features automatic integrity and power recovery, and onboard smart torpedo support. Its advanced user interfacing enables holographic sensor reconstruction for increased environmental awareness. Automatic targeting and target integrity analysis supports threat classification and prioritization. Finally, fired torpedoes intercept locked targets with high efficiency while built-in safety mechanics avoid harming the origin craft.\nYou can craft it at any Mobile Vehicle Bay.",
