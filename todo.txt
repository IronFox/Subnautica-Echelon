echelon todos:

* disable all access to C:\temp both in the unity scene and the plugin. Redirect to Debug.*
* update version number *

* sub: 
	* scale explosion
	* check load savegame with boarded echelon
	* disable uh oh voice
	* block torpedo launch if vehicle speed is too high (>20m/s forward). Show onscreen warning when trying anyway
	* make target markers flat sprites
	* add target name, health, max health, distance, and current speed as text next to marker
	* add option to automatically fire at warpers
	* decrease torpedo tube open/close animation time
	* add option for off-board sentry mode (sub turns and fires at targets automatically that approach the player)
	* do not explode torpedoes if close to the player (Camera.main when off-boarded)
	* add camera shake on overdrive (use Random.insideUnitSphere)
	* torpedos fired with no target should always collide with terrain

	* add trailing camera flash light (done)
	* add healing visualisation using hull geometry and animated additive shader (done)
	* fix flickering of battery change bar (it's as good as it gets)
	* add debug panel that shows various status values on the hud (not yet configurable, done)
	* add storage and upgrade access (upgrades maybe later, storage no)
	* add custom icon presumably via CraftingSprite (done)
	* set recipe (done)
	* propeller still rotates while docked (fixed)
	* link mouse wheel to zoom axis (done)
	* restore all directions on undock from docked orientation (done)
	* add energy drain and batteries (done)
	* increase all speeds +50%	(done - only overdrive)
	* when returning from outside water while free camera is active, free camera ship direction should copy falling vector (done)
	* when opening inventory, only move camera on final state	 (done)
	* transfer occlusion maps to albedo	(done)
	* disable overdrive when moving backwards, reduce reverse speed to prevent backwards jumping (done)
* explosions:
	* increase torpedo damage +50%. Make damage configurable (done)
	* reduce size (done, using KriptoFX)
	* use Subnautica sound source to fix 3d issues (done)
	* add light source (done, using KriptoFX)
	* pressure wave should use lit material but face normal to the inside (won't do, using KriptoFX)
	* add smolder sphere (done, using KriptoFX)
* torpedoes:
	* accelerate torpedoes (again, done)
	* model mesh	 (done)
	* split covers into two	(done)
	* animate covers	(done)
