	* use Subnautica sound source to fix 3d issues (done)
	* add light source (done, using KriptoFX)
	* pressure wave should use lit material but face normal to the inside (won't do, using KriptoFX)
	* add smolder sphere (done, using KriptoFX)
* torpedoes:
	* model mesh
	* split covers into two
	* animate covers
	* torpedo behavior (lock on targets)
	* torpedo trigger explosion and damage targets
	* deploy torpedo from ship on trigger press
* sub: 
	* when opening inventory, only move camera on final state
	* propeller still rotates while docked
	* restore all directions on undock from docked orientation
	* increase all speeds +50%
	* transfer occlusion maps to albedo	(done)
	* add camera shake on overdrive or nearby explosion
	* disable overdrive when moving backwards, reduce reverse speed to prevent backwards jumping. Alternatively: allow reverse jumps
	* when returning from outside water while free camera is active, free camera ship direction should copy falling vector
	
* disable all access to C:\temp both in the unity scene and the plugin
